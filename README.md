### 2. **Market Sentiment and Liquidity Analysis**
The bot scans social media platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and Discord to gauge market sentiment about specific tokens. It also monitors liquidity to ensure seamless trading.

#### **Key Functions:**
   - **Social Media Sentiment:** Tracks mentions, hashtags, and keywords such as "pump," "moon," or token-specific phrases.
   - **Liquidity Monitoring:** Identifies low-liquidity tokens prone to manipulation.
   - **Sentiment Breakdown:** Provides positive, negative, and neutral sentiment percentages for actionable insights.

#### **Use Case:**
Identify hyped tokens with positive sentiment and sufficient liquidity for trading.

### 3. **Outlier Detection**
Sophisticated algorithms pinpoint unusual market activity that might indicate a pump. The bot evaluates:
   - Sudden spikes in price or volume.
   - Abnormal trading patterns compared to historical data.

#### **Tools Used:**
   - **Z-Score Analysis:** Flags deviations beyond normal thresholds.
   - **Interquartile Range (IQR):** Detects anomalies in token trading behavior.

#### **Benefits:**
Quickly isolates tokens exhibiting unusual trends, minimizing noise in the detection process.

The bot continuously monitors order books on supported exchanges to detect manipulative activities.

#### **Features:**
   - **Buy Walls:** Identifies large buy orders intended to artificially inflate prices.
   - **Sell Walls:** Detects large sell orders creating downward pressure.
   - **Order Flow Analysis:** Tracks how orders are placed, canceled, or filled.

#### **Outcome:**

#### **Capabilities:**
   - Sentiment scoring for individual tokens.
   - Real-time updates from high-traffic platforms.
   - Keyword-based filters for relevant discussions.

#### **Why It Matters:**
Pump-and-dump schemes often rely on social media hype. Sentiment analysis helps detect manipulations early.

   - **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** Tracks momentum shifts.
   - **Bollinger Bands:** Identifies rapid price changes.

#### **Benefits:**
Predicts pump scenarios by identifying abnormal price accelerations.
